# Excercise 1: File Structure

### We are going to create the file structure needed for the course. This will consist of 6 folder total. 1 to hold all of our units, and 1 for each unit (adding up to 5). This will help us keep organized and allow us to practice with the terminal. 

## Directions:
1. Open your Terminal / Command Prompt / or Power Shell
2. Navigate to your desktop (Or a place where you want to keep your files) using `cd \<folder_name\>`. You can also use ls to list the folders in your current directory to help you navigate.
3. Use `mkdir` to create your first folder. I recommend something like pdx_code.
4. Now change directories into the folder you just created.
5. Use `mkdir` to make a folder for each unit in the course. You will need to do this 5 times. I reccomend calling them unit_1, unit_2 and so on.
6. Thats it! We are done! Now take a screen shot of your 5 unit folders so you can submit this excercise. 

If done correctly your terminal should look like this when you use the command `ls`:

And your finder/file explorer should look like:
