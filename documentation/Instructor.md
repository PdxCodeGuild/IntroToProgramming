    - What is programming? Before we jump into programming, let's review the interpreter by doing Lab 0.

### Unit 01

#### Lab 0: Terminal Review

Important things to point out:
  - file hierarchy
  - bash `$` vs. python terminal `>>>`

_10 min break_

#### Lab 1: writing a python file and executing
Important things to point out:
  - Terminal path must be the same as the file you're executing
  - different terminal commands for windows `py` and mac `python3`

_10 min break_

#### Lab 2: Handling inputs and formatting strings.
Important things to point out:
  - must save the result of `input()` if you plan to use it later
  - `fstrings` are the most efficient way but not the only way
  - `'''` triple quotes are for multi-line strings only (including comments)
