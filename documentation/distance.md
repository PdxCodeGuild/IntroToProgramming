## Support

### During Class
If you find that you have a question when class **is in session**, please use the **Google Meet Chat** function. That way if someone else has the same question, the TA can answer it for everyone!

- To initiate the chatroom, click on the **chat button** in the middle in the top right corner.

- Then ask away! Don't be shy. Chances are, everyone is wondering the same thing.

### Outside of Class

If you find that you have a question when class **is not** in session, please use Slack to message Al Burns with any questions. [Please see this doc on how to use Slack](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/slack.md).

## Homework

Homework should be turned in at the end of class via Slack ([Please see this doc on how to use Slack](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/slack.md)). If you need more time, the next day will be fine. Distance learners will send their homework via Slack direct message to Al:

- Create a new direct message
- search "Al"
- his avatar is a cat playing the piano
