### <a id="lists"></a>Lists
- [List Overview](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

- [Quiz: Lists](https://forms.gle/dwgvYsHkvUSTMCiWA)

A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.

```python
fruits = [] # empty list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # initialized list with three items
print(fruits) #outcome: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# print the item at this index position
print(fruits[0]) #outcome: "apple"
print(fruits[1]) #outcome: "banana"
print(fruits[2]) #outcome: "cherry"

# for each item in the fruit list, print the item and its index
for fruit in fruits:
  print(f"{fruit} has an index of {fruits.index(fruit)}")
```

### <a id="modules"></a>Modules
Modules are sources of code; similar to a library. It is a file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application. (For a list of all modules, you can check out the offical [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)). For this lesson, we will be looking at the [random module](https://pynative.com/python-random-module/). And specifically, we will be looking at the choice() function of the random module: [random.choice()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_choice.asp). Please see the example below:

```python
# include the random module in our file
import random

# a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# randomly choose a fruit and save it to a variable, chosen_fruit
# choice() is a function inside the random module. we use it by writing random.choice()
# the list in which you want the program to choose from, needs to go inside the parenthesis of choice()
chosen_fruit = random.choice(fruits)

# print the value of variable chosen_fruit
print(chosen_fruit)
```
Let's practice random.choice() in the next lab.
