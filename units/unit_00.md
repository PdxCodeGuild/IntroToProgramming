Welcome to Intro to Programming! To have a successful start in the class, please prep for the class by doing the following:

## Download
- latest version of Python
  - [Instructions for Windows](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/tree/master/documentation/python_windows.md)
  - [Instructions for Mac](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/tree/master/documentation/python_mac.md)
  - [Instructions for all other operating systems](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - Atom is where we will be writing our code. Some other alternatives are Sublime, PyCharm, and VSCode. However, we'll be using Atom in class.

Can't or don't want to install software on your computer? Check out [Repl.it](repl.it). It's a cloud based editor and interpreter that will allow you to run Python without downloading any software. Please note, you will need to create an account. Check out this tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSAf97ROes4).


## Practice
The terminal will be a vital tool for running our code. Complete [Lab 0](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/labs/lab00-newfolder.md) to get a quick understanding of how the terminal works.

## Want a deeper dive?

Get some additional practice by working through the introduction and exercises 1-6 of the [Command Line Crash Course](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course). Stop at **Super User**.

## Putting it together

On the first day of class, you will see how Atom and the terminal work together to run your python code. If you'd like to see for yourself, please see [Lab 0](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/labs/lab00-interpreter.md)
