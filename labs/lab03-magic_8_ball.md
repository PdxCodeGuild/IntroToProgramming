## Instructions

Let's write a program to simulate the classic "[Magic Eight Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)"

1. Print a welcome screen to the user.
2. Prompt the user to ask the 8-ball a question.
  - For example: "Will I win the lottery tomorrow?"
3. Use the random module's `random.choice()` to choose a prediction.  
4. Display the result of the prediction.

## Advanced version 1

- Let the user choose if they want to ask a second question.

## Advanced version 2

- Ask the user if they want to ask another question, using a while loop.
