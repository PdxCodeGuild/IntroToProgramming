## Instructions

Let's write a program to simulate the classic "[Magic Eight Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)"

1. Print a welcome screen to the user.
2. Use the random module's `random.choice()` to choose a prediction.
3. Prompt the user to ask the 8-ball a question "will I win the lottery tomorrow?"
5. Display the result of the 8 ball.


## Advanced

- Ask the user if they want to ask another question, using a while loop


## Concepts

- Event Loops
- User I/O
- Random Module
