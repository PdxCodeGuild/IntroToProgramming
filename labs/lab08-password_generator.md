# Lab 8: Password Generator

Let's generate a password ten characters long using a loop (`while` loop or `for` loop) and `random.choice`, this will be a string of random characters.


## Advanced Version 1

Allow the user to choose how many characters the password will be.

## Advanced Version 2

Allow the user to choose how many letters, numbers, and punctuation characters they want in their password. Mix everything up using `list()`, `random.shuffle()`, and `''.join()`.

[//]: # (show them the 'string builder pattern', how a string is build one character at a time)
