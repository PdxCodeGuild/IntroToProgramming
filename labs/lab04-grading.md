# Lab 4: Grading

Let's convert a number grade to a letter grade, using `if` and `elif` statements and comparisons.

1. Have the user enter a number representing the grade (0-100)
2. Convert the number grade to a letter grade

## Numeric Ranges

- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- 0-59: F

## Version 2

Use `%` to get the remainder of the grade when divided by ten, and use that number to decide whether they will get a `+` or a `-` appended to their grade. For example, the grade `81` would be a 'B'. `81 % 10` would give you 1, so you would add a '-' to the end of the grade.
